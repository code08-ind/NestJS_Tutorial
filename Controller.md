# Contoller

## Description

A controller's purpose is to receive specific requests for the application. 

Controller basically takes the HTTP request and then provides it with the functionality it needs to render the view.

Controller then handles the request and returns the appropriate view with the data requested.

Routing decides which controller receives which requests. 

Often, there is more than one route to each controller, and different routes can be served by different actions. 

Each action's purpose is to collect information to provide it to a view.

Spec file is used for the test cases.
